# GridFSR
Simulations of Modified Fish Eye Routing Algorithm in NS2

This repository contains the code base of my Bachelor's thesis, published as published as -
Ramakrishna, Jaidev & Varier Raghu et al (2015), "Fish Eye State Routing in Mobile Ad-Hoc Networks", Department of Computer Science, PIIT/Bombay University

These simulations model the behavior of the Grid FSR algorithm designed by my team, in networks of varying density.

This code was written to run on NS2 2.35, but has been shown to also run on 2.27 (although you will probably spend more time fixing all the bugs in the software than running the simulations if you choose to use older NS2 versions).
